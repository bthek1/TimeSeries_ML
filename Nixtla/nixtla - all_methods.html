<p>Statistical, Machine Learning, and Neural Forecasting Methods In this tutorial, we will explore the process of forecasting on the M5 dataset by utilizing the most suitable model for each time series. We’ll accomplish this through an essential technique known as cross-validation. This approach helps us in estimating the predictive performance of our models, and in selecting the model that yields the best performance for each time series.</p>
<p>The M5 dataset comprises of hierarchical sales data, spanning five years, from Walmart. The aim is to forecast daily sales for the next 28 days. The dataset is broken down into the 50 states of America, with 10 stores in each state.</p>
<p>In the realm of time series forecasting and analysis, one of the more complex tasks is identifying the model that is optimally suited for a specific group of series. Quite often, this selection process leans heavily on intuition, which may not necessarily align with the empirical reality of our dataset.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, we aim to provide a more structured, data-driven approach to model selection for different groups of series within the M5 benchmark dataset. This dataset, well-known in the field of forecasting, allows us to showcase the versatility and power of our methodology.</p>
<p>We will train an assortment of models from various forecasting paradigms:</p>
<p><em><a href="(https://github.com/Nixtla/statsforecast)">StatsForecast</a></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Baseline models: These models are simple yet often highly effective for providing an initial perspective on the forecasting problem. We will use <code>SeasonalNaive</code> and <code>HistoricAverage</code> models for this category.</li>
<li>Intermittent models: For series with sporadic, non-continuous demand, we will utilize models like <code>CrostonOptimized</code>, <code>IMAPA</code>, and <code>ADIDA</code>. These models are particularly suited for handling zero-inflated series.</li>
<li>State Space Models: These are statistical models that use mathematical descriptions of a system to make predictions. The <code>AutoETS</code> model from the statsforecast library falls under this category.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><a href="https://github.com/Nixtla/mlforecast">MLForecast</a></em></p>
<p>Machine Learning: Leveraging ML models like <code>LightGBM</code>, <code>XGBoost</code>, and <code>LinearRegression</code> can be advantageous due to their capacity to uncover intricate patterns in data. We’ll use the MLForecast library for this purpose.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://github.com/Nixtla/neuralforecast">NeuralForecast</a></em></p>
<p>Deep Learning: DL models, such as Transformers (<code>AutoTFT</code>) and Neural Networks (<code>AutoNHITS</code>), allow us to handle complex non-linear dependencies in time series data. We’ll utilize the NeuralForecast library for these models.</p>
<p>Using the Nixtla suite of libraries, we’ll be able to drive our model selection process with data, ensuring we utilize the most suitable models for specific groups of series in our dataset.</p>
<p>Outline:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Reading Data: In this initial step, we load our dataset into memory, making it available for our subsequent analysis and forecasting. It is important to understand the structure and nuances of the dataset at this stage.</p></li>
<li><p>Forecasting Using Statistical and Deep Learning Methods: We apply a wide range of forecasting methods from basic statistical techniques to advanced deep learning models. The aim is to generate predictions for the next 28 days based on our dataset.</p></li>
<li><p>Model Performance Evaluation on Different Windows: We assess the performance of our models on distinct windows.</p></li>
<li><p>Selecting the Best Model for a Group of Series: Using the performance evaluation, we identify the optimal model for each group of series. This step ensures that the chosen model is tailored to the unique characteristics of each group.</p></li>
<li><p>Filtering the Best Possible Forecast: Finally, we filter the forecasts generated by our chosen models to obtain the most promising predictions. This is our final output and represents the best possible forecast for each series according to our models.</p></li>

<p><code>StatsForecast</code> is a comprehensive library providing a suite of popular univariate time series forecasting models, all designed with a focus on high performance and scalability.</p>
<p>Here’s what makes StatsForecast a powerful tool for time series forecasting:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Collection of Local Models</strong>: StatsForecast provides a diverse collection of local models that can be applied to each time series individually, allowing us to capture unique patterns within each series.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Simplicity</strong>: With StatsForecast, training, forecasting, and backtesting multiple models become a straightforward process, requiring only a few lines of code. This simplicity makes it a convenient tool for both beginners and experienced practitioners.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Optimized for Speed</strong>: The implementation of the models in StatsForecast is optimized for speed, ensuring that large-scale computations are performed efficiently, thereby reducing the overall time for model training and prediction.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Horizontal Scalability</strong>: One of the distinguishing features of StatsForecast is its ability to scale horizontally. It is compatible with distributed computing frameworks such as Spark, Dask, and Ray. This feature allows it to handle large datasets by distributing the computations across multiple nodes in a cluster, making it a go-to solution for large-scale time series forecasting tasks.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><code>StatsForecast</code> receives a list of models to fit each time series. Since we are dealing with Daily data, it would be benefitial to use 7 as seasonality.</p>

<p>We fit the models by instantiating a new StatsForecast object with the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>models</code>: a list of models. Select the models you want from models and import them.</li>
<li><code>freq</code>: a string indicating the frequency of the data. (See panda’s available frequencies.)</li>
<li><code>n_jobs</code>: int, number of jobs used in the parallel processing, use -1 for all cores.</li>
<li><code>fallback_model</code>: a model to be used if a model fails. Any settings are passed into the constructor. Then you call its fit method and pass in the historical data frame.</li>

<p>The forecast method takes two arguments: forecasts next h (horizon) and level.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>h</code> (int): represents the forecast h steps into the future. In this case, 12 months ahead.</li>
<li><code>level</code> (list of floats): this optional parameter is used for probabilistic forecasting. Set the level (or confidence percentile) of your prediction interval. For example, level=[90] means that the model expects the real value to be inside that interval 90% of the times.</li>
</ul>
<p>The forecast object here is a new data frame that includes a column with the name of the model and the y hat values, as well as columns for the uncertainty intervals.</p>
<p>This block of code times how long it takes to run the forecasting function of the StatsForecast class, which predicts the next 28 days (h=28). The level is set to [90], meaning it will compute the 90% prediction interval. The time is calculated in minutes and printed out at the end.</p>

<p><code>NeuralForecast</code> is a robust collection of neural forecasting models that focuses on usability and performance. It includes a variety of model architectures, from classic networks such as Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to novel contributions like N-BEATS, N-HITS, Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT), and more.</p>
<p>Key features of <code>NeuralForecast</code> include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A broad collection of global models. Out of the box implementation of MLP, LSTM, RNN, TCN, DilatedRNN, NBEATS, NHITS, ESRNN, TFT, Informer, PatchTST and HINT.</li>
<li>A simple and intuitive interface that allows training, forecasting, and backtesting of various models in a few lines of code.</li>
<li>Support for GPU acceleration to improve computational speed.</li>
</ul>
<p>This machine doesn’t have GPU, but Google Colabs offers some for free.</p>
<p>Using <a href="https://nixtla.github.io/neuralforecast/examples/intermittentdata.html">Colab’s GPU to train NeuralForecast</a>.</p>

<h1>Validate Model’s Performance</h1>
<p>The three libraries - <code>StatsForecast</code>, <code>MLForecast</code>, and <code>NeuralForecast</code> - offer out-of-the-box cross-validation capabilities specifically designed for time series. This allows us to evaluate the model’s performance using historical data to obtain an unbiased assessment of how well each model is likely to perform on unseen data.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cross-validation-in-statsforecast">Cross Validation in StatsForecast</h2>
<p>The <code>cross_validation</code> method from the <code>StatsForecast</code> class accepts the following arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>df</code>: A DataFrame representing the training data.</li>
<li><code>h</code> (int): The forecast horizon, represented as the number of steps into the future that we wish to predict. For example, if we’re forecasting hourly data, <code>h=24</code> would represent a 24-hour forecast.</li>
<li><code>step_size</code> (int): The step size between each cross-validation window. This parameter determines how often we want to run the forecasting process.</li>
<li><code>n_windows</code> (int): The number of windows used for cross validation. This parameter defines how many past forecasting processes we want to evaluate.</li>
</ul>
<p>These parameters allow us to control the extent and granularity of our cross-validation process. By tuning these settings, we can balance between computational cost and the thoroughness of the cross-validation.</p>
